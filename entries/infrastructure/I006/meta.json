  "context": "The 2020-2023 chip shortage exposed dangerous concentration — TSMC in Taiwan produces 90% of advanced semiconductors. Governments responded with reshoring initiatives: the US CHIPS Act ($52B), EU Chips Act (€43B), Japan and South Korea with similar programs. The goal is supply chain security through domestic manufacturing. But semiconductor fabs take 3-5 years to build and cost $10-20B each. The talent pool for advanced chip manufacturing is concentrated in East Asia. Reshored fabs produce chips at 30-50% higher cost than Asian equivalents. And by the time new fabs come online, the shortage that motivated them has passed and the technology node has advanced. The reshoring investment addresses yesterday's crisis at tomorrow's prices, while the fundamental concentration in TSMC's most advanced nodes remains unchanged.",
