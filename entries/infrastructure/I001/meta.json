  "context": "Organizations migrate to cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) for agility, scalability, and cost efficiency. The migration works. Then dependency deepens. Proprietary services, managed databases, serverless functions, and cloud-native tooling create lock-in that makes switching providers a multi-year, multi-million dollar project. When the provider has an outage, your business has an outage. When they raise prices, you pay. The cloud promised freedom from infrastructure. It delivered a different kind of dependency.",
