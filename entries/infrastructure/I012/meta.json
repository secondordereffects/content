  "context": "Content Delivery Networks were designed to make the internet faster and more reliable by distributing content across global edge servers. And they do — for normal operations. But the CDN market has consolidated dramatically. Cloudflare, Akamai, and Fastly together serve a majority of internet traffic. When one of these providers has an outage, it doesn't take down one website — it takes down thousands simultaneously. The June 2021 Fastly outage knocked out Amazon, Reddit, the UK government, and major news sites for an hour. The Cloudflare outage in June 2022 disrupted Discord, Shopify, and thousands of businesses. The infrastructure designed to prevent single points of failure has itself become a single point of failure, just at a higher level of abstraction.",
