  "context": "Consumers adopt smart home devices for convenience — voice-controlled lights, automated thermostats, smart locks, connected cameras. Each device works well individually. But smart home ecosystems are designed around platform lock-in. Alexa devices work best with Amazon services, Google Home with Google, HomeKit with Apple. As consumers accumulate devices within one ecosystem, switching costs compound. When the platform vendor changes pricing, discontinues products, or suffers outages, the entire home is affected. The convenience that drew people in becomes a dependency they cannot easily escape, and the smart home becomes a subscription to a platform rather than ownership of infrastructure.",
