  "context": "Countries invest heavily in solar and wind to replace fossil fuels, driven by falling costs and climate targets. Renewable capacity additions break records annually. But generation capacity is not the bottleneck — storage is. Solar produces peak power at midday when demand is moderate, and nothing at night when demand peaks. Wind is unpredictable. Without grid-scale storage, renewables require fossil fuel backup for reliability, creating a system that pays for two generation fleets while using each one part-time. The storage gap means every gigawatt of renewable capacity added without matching storage increases grid complexity and cost without proportionally reducing emissions.",
