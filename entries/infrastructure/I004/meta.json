  "context": "Smart city initiatives promise urban efficiency through data. Sensors monitor traffic flow, air quality, energy usage, and pedestrian patterns. The data optimizes traffic lights, reduces energy waste, and improves emergency response. The pitch to city councils is compelling: save money, reduce emissions, improve services. But smart city infrastructure is surveillance infrastructure with a different label. The same sensors that optimize traffic also track individual vehicles. The same cameras that monitor air quality can run facial recognition. The same WiFi access points that provide free internet track device locations. Once the infrastructure is deployed for efficiency, repurposing it for surveillance requires only a software update, not new hardware. And the vendors who sell smart city platforms also sell surveillance tools to law enforcement — often through the same contract.",
