  "context": "AI training and inference require massive compute, which requires massive electricity. Data centers are being built at unprecedented rates to meet AI demand. But the power grid wasn't designed for this. A single large AI data center can consume as much electricity as a small city. Utilities are delaying coal plant retirements, building new natural gas plants, and raising rates for residential customers to meet data center demand. The clean energy transition is being slowed by the very technology companies that pledged to accelerate it.",
