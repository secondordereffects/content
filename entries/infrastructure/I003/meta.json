  "context": "Electric vehicles are positioned as the solution to transportation emissions. Governments worldwide mandate EV adoption — the EU bans new ICE vehicle sales from 2035, California from 2035, and dozens of countries have similar targets. But the electrical grid wasn't designed for millions of vehicles charging simultaneously. A single Level 2 home charger draws as much power as an entire house. A DC fast charger draws as much as a small commercial building. When an entire neighborhood plugs in after the evening commute, local transformers overload. The grid needs massive upgrades — new transformers, substations, transmission lines — that take 5-10 years to build. The EV mandate timeline and the grid upgrade timeline are fundamentally misaligned. And the electricity itself still comes largely from fossil fuels in most grids, shifting emissions from tailpipes to power plants.",
