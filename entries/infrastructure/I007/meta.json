  "context": "SpaceX launches Starlink satellites at a pace of 40-60 per month. Amazon's Project Kuiper, OneWeb, and dozens of other operators are adding thousands more. The total number of active satellites has grown from 2,000 in 2019 to over 10,000 in 2025, with plans for 100,000+ by 2030. Each satellite operates in low Earth orbit (LEO) for 5-7 years before deorbiting. But collisions, failures, and fragmentation create debris that doesn't deorbit. NASA tracks 30,000+ debris objects larger than 10cm, and estimates 100 million+ fragments too small to track but large enough to destroy a satellite. The Kessler Syndrome — a cascading chain reaction where debris from one collision creates more debris that causes more collisions — is no longer theoretical. At current launch rates, orbital density in popular LEO bands may cross the threshold where cascading collisions become self-sustaining within 20-30 years.",
