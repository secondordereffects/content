  "context": "5G was marketed as revolutionary — 100x faster than 4G, enabling autonomous vehicles, remote surgery, and IoT at scale. Carriers spent $100B+ on spectrum and deployment. But 5G comes in three flavors with very different characteristics. Low-band 5G is barely faster than 4G. Mid-band offers meaningful improvement but requires 3-4x more cell sites. High-band mmWave delivers the promised speeds but has a range of only 500 meters and can't penetrate walls. The 5G that was marketed — multi-gigabit speeds everywhere — is physically impossible without a cell site on every block. Most consumers experience 5G as a slightly faster version of 4G with a new icon on their phone. The revolutionary use cases (remote surgery, autonomous vehicles) require the mmWave variant that covers less than 1% of the country.",
