  "context": "Deep-sea mining targets polymetallic nodules on the ocean floor containing cobalt, nickel, manganese, and rare earths critical for batteries and electronics. Proponents argue it's less destructive than terrestrial mining and necessary for the energy transition. But the deep ocean floor is one of Earth's least understood ecosystems. Nodules that took millions of years to form support unique organisms. Sediment plumes from mining spread hundreds of kilometers, smothering filter feeders and disrupting food chains. The environmental impact assessment frameworks developed for land don't apply to an ecosystem we've barely mapped, and the damage may be irreversible on human timescales.",
