  "context": "Governments invest billions in broadband infrastructure to connect everyone — the US Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program alone allocated $42.5B. The promise is universal connectivity. But fiber deployment follows economic logic: dense urban areas get fiber first because the cost per connection is lowest. Rural areas, where the need is greatest, get served last or not at all. The economics are brutal — running fiber to a rural home can cost $10,000-50,000 per connection vs $500-2,000 in urban areas. Subsidies help but don't close the gap. The result is a digital divide that mirrors and amplifies existing economic divides. Urban areas get gigabit fiber while rural areas rely on satellite or fixed wireless with higher latency and lower reliability. The infrastructure investment meant to connect everyone ends up connecting the already-connected first.",
