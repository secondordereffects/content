  "context": "Nuclear power is experiencing a renaissance driven by climate goals and AI data center energy demands. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are signing nuclear power agreements. Small modular reactors (SMRs) promise cheaper, faster deployment. The argument is compelling: nuclear provides reliable, carbon-free baseload power that renewables can't match. But the waste problem remains unsolved after 70 years. No country has a permanent repository for high-level nuclear waste. The US spent $15B on Yucca Mountain before abandoning it. Spent fuel sits in temporary storage at reactor sites — some for decades. Each new reactor adds to the waste inventory with no disposal path. SMRs may actually produce more waste per unit of energy than conventional reactors. The renaissance is building new reactors on the assumption that future generations will solve the waste problem — the same assumption made in the 1950s.",
