  "context": "The electric vehicle revolution requires massive lithium production for batteries. Global lithium demand is projected to increase 5-7x by 2030. Lithium is marketed as enabling the green transition, but extraction carries significant environmental costs. Brine extraction in South America's lithium triangle consumes 500,000 gallons of water per ton of lithium in some of Earth's driest regions. Hard rock mining in Australia generates toxic waste. The environmental cost of extracting the mineral that powers green technology creates a paradox: solving climate change at the macro level while creating water crises and ecosystem destruction at the local level.",
