  "context": "Autonomous vehicles promise to reduce accidents, eliminate parking needs, and optimize traffic flow. Cities plan for this future by investing in smart infrastructure, V2X communication systems, and AV-ready road designs. But the transition period — decades of mixed human and autonomous traffic — creates infrastructure demands that neither system was designed for. Roads need both traditional signage and digital communication. Parking structures built for human drivers become stranded assets while new pickup/dropoff zones create congestion. The infrastructure investment required for the transition may exceed the cost of the final autonomous state, and cities that invest early risk building for a future that arrives differently than planned.",
