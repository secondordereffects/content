  "context": "Satellite internet constellations (Starlink, OneWeb, Kuiper) promise to solve rural connectivity by beaming broadband from low Earth orbit. For underserved areas with no fiber or cable options, satellite internet is transformative. But marketing promises of broadband-equivalent service obscure fundamental physics constraints. LEO satellites at 550 km altitude add 20-40ms latency minimum, with real-world performance of 40-80ms. During peak hours, shared bandwidth degrades speeds significantly. Weather affects signal quality. And the economics require massive subscriber density to justify constellation maintenance costs, meaning rural areas — the primary use case — may see service degradation as urban subscribers are prioritized.",
