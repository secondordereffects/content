  "context": "Data centers generate enormous heat that must be dissipated. The most common cooling method uses water — evaporative cooling towers that consume millions of gallons per day. As AI drives explosive data center growth, water consumption is becoming a critical issue. Data centers are being built in regions already facing water stress. A single large data center can consume as much water as a small city, competing with agriculture, residential use, and ecosystems for an increasingly scarce resource.",
