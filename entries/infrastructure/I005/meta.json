  "context": "The internet feels decentralized and resilient. In reality, 97% of intercontinental data flows through approximately 550 submarine fiber optic cables laid on the ocean floor. These cables are concentrated in a handful of geographic chokepoints: the Strait of Malacca, the Suez Canal corridor, the English Channel, and a few landing stations on each continent. A single cable cut can reroute traffic for millions. Coordinated cuts at chokepoints could sever entire regions from the global internet. Nation-states are increasingly aware of this vulnerability, and submarine cable sabotage has moved from theoretical risk to documented reality, with multiple suspected state-sponsored cable cuts in the Baltic Sea and Red Sea since 2023.",
