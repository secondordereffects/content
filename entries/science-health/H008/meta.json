  "context": "Modern hygiene practices — antibacterial soaps, hand sanitizers, antimicrobial surfaces, sterile environments — have dramatically reduced infectious disease. This is an unambiguous public health triumph. But the hygiene hypothesis, now supported by decades of research, suggests we've overshot. The human microbiome — trillions of bacteria that regulate immune function, digestion, and even mental health — evolved in a microbially rich environment. Excessive sanitization disrupts this ecosystem. Children raised in hyper-clean environments develop more allergies, asthma, and autoimmune conditions. The post-COVID sanitization surge amplified this trend. Hand sanitizer use increased 600%. Antimicrobial product sales doubled. The immune systems of an entire generation of children were trained in an unusually sterile environment during critical developmental windows.",
