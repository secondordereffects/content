  "context": "Mental health apps — Calm, Headspace, BetterHelp, Woebot — promise accessible, affordable mental health support. The market exploded to $6B+ as therapy waitlists grew and stigma decreased. For mild anxiety and stress, these tools can help. But mental health apps create a dependency pattern that mirrors the conditions they treat. Users develop a reliance on the app for emotional regulation rather than building internal coping skills. Meditation apps that track streaks create anxiety about maintaining streaks. Therapy apps with subscription models have financial incentives to maintain engagement rather than resolve issues. The data privacy implications are severe — mental health data is among the most sensitive, yet many apps share data with advertisers. The app that was supposed to be a bridge to better mental health becomes a crutch that prevents the development of genuine resilience.",
