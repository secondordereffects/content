  "context": "The patent system grants pharmaceutical companies 20-year monopolies to incentivize drug innovation. The logic is sound: without patent protection, no company would invest $2-3B to develop a drug that competitors could immediately copy. But the patent system creates perverse incentives as expiration approaches. Companies spend more on extending patents (evergreening) than on genuine innovation. They file hundreds of secondary patents on formulations, delivery methods, and combinations to delay generic entry. R&D shifts from breakthrough drugs to incremental modifications of existing ones. The system designed to incentivize innovation increasingly incentivizes patent gaming, while truly novel drug development declines.",
