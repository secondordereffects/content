  "context": "Health wearables (Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Whoop) promise to empower patients with continuous health data — heart rate, HRV, blood oxygen, sleep stages, activity levels. The data is real and increasingly accurate. But continuous health monitoring creates a new category of anxiety. Users obsess over metrics they don't fully understand, interpret normal variation as pathology, and flood doctors with false-positive alerts. The worried well become the worried wearable, seeking medical attention for algorithmically flagged non-issues while the genuinely useful signals (AFib detection, fall detection) get lost in the noise of health data anxiety.",
