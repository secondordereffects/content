  "context": "Plastic was marketed as recyclable. In reality, less than 9% of plastic ever produced has been recycled. The rest breaks down into microplastics — particles smaller than 5mm — that are now found everywhere: in ocean water, drinking water, food, air, human blood, placentas, and brain tissue. We are only beginning to understand the health effects of chronic microplastic exposure, but early research suggests endocrine disruption, inflammation, and potential carcinogenic effects. The plastic age created a contamination problem that will outlast every person alive today.",
