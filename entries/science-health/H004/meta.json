  "context": "CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is hailed as a revolution — precise, programmable DNA scissors that can cure genetic diseases. The first CRISPR therapies are approved (Casgevy for sickle cell disease). The promise is extraordinary: fix the genetic root cause rather than treating symptoms. But CRISPR's precision is imperfect. Off-target edits — cuts at unintended locations in the genome — occur at rates of 0.1-10% depending on the guide RNA and target. These off-target effects may be silent, or they may disrupt tumor suppressor genes, activate oncogenes, or cause chromosomal rearrangements. The effects may not manifest for years or decades. We're editing the human genome with a tool that's precise enough to be useful but not precise enough to be fully safe, and the consequences of errors are irreversible and heritable in germline editing.",
