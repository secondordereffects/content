  "context": "Eggs are bad. No, eggs are fine. Fat is the enemy. Actually, sugar is the enemy. Butter will kill you. Wait, margarine is worse. Red wine is heart-healthy. No, any alcohol is harmful. Nutrition science has reversed its major recommendations so frequently that the public has developed a rational response: ignore all of it. The problem is structural. Most nutrition research relies on observational studies, food frequency questionnaires (notoriously inaccurate), and short-term interventions that can't capture decades-long health effects. Industry funding biases results — the sugar industry funded research blaming fat for heart disease for 50 years. The result is a field where confident public health recommendations are built on weak evidence, and when they reverse, they erode trust not just in nutrition science but in scientific authority broadly.",
