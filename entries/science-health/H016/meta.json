  "context": "A new class of weight-loss medications delivers clinically significant results — patients lose 15-20% of body weight. Adoption is the fastest for any drug class in recent history. But these drugs manage obesity rather than cure it. When patients stop, the majority of lost weight returns within a year. The medical system is creating millions of patients on indefinite prescriptions costing over $1,000/month, while long-term metabolic and body composition consequences remain understudied.",
