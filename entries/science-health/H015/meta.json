  "context": "Precision medicine promises treatments tailored to individual genetic profiles, lifestyle data, and biomarkers. The potential is transformative: drugs matched to your genome, cancer treatments targeting your specific mutations, preventive interventions based on your risk profile. But precision medicine requires the most intimate data possible — your complete genome, medical history, lifestyle patterns, and family health data. This data, once collected, becomes a permanent privacy liability. Genetic data cannot be changed like a password. It reveals information about relatives who never consented. And the databases required for precision medicine are irresistible targets for insurers, employers, and hackers seeking the most personal information imaginable.",
