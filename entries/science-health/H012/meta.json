  "context": "Parents give children tablets and smartphones loaded with educational apps, believing screen time can be beneficial if the content is educational. Pediatric guidelines recommend limits, but enforcement is difficult when screens are the most effective pacifier available. Research increasingly shows that the medium matters as much as the content. Even educational screen time displaces activities critical for development: unstructured play, face-to-face interaction, physical exploration, and boredom-driven creativity. The displacement effect means that what children aren't doing while on screens may matter more than what they are doing on them.",
