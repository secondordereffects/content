  "context": "Antibiotics are one of humanity's greatest achievements — they turned previously fatal infections into minor inconveniences. But bacteria evolve. Every use of antibiotics creates selection pressure that favors resistant strains. We use antibiotics not just for human medicine but for livestock growth promotion, agricultural disease prevention, and prophylactic treatment. 70-80% of antibiotics sold in the US go to animal agriculture. The result: antibiotic-resistant infections are rising exponentially, and the pipeline of new antibiotics has nearly dried up because they're not profitable enough for pharmaceutical companies to develop.",
