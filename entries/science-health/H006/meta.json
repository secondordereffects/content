  "context": "After COVID-19 killed millions and cost the global economy trillions, the world vowed 'never again.' Governments created pandemic preparedness offices, funded surveillance systems, and stockpiled supplies. But institutional memory is short and budgets are competitive. Within 3 years of the pandemic's acute phase, preparedness funding was being cut, surveillance systems defunded, and stockpiles allowed to expire. The pattern is well-documented: after every major pandemic (1918 flu, 2003 SARS, 2009 H1N1, 2014 Ebola), the world invests in preparedness, then defunds it when the threat feels distant. COVID-19 was supposed to be different because of its unprecedented scale. It wasn't. The preparedness infrastructure built in 2020-2022 is already eroding, and the next pandemic — which epidemiologists consider a certainty — will find us less prepared than we were in 2019.",
