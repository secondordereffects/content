  "context": "Longevity research attracts billions in funding from tech billionaires and biotech investors pursuing radical life extension. The science is advancing — senolytics, epigenetic reprogramming, and caloric restriction mimetics show promise. But life extension technologies will initially be expensive and available only to the wealthy. If the rich live to 120-150 while average lifespan remains 75-80, the implications cascade through every social system: retirement ages, inheritance patterns, political power concentration, and intergenerational wealth gaps. A 50-year gap in lifespan between rich and poor would create a biological class system unprecedented in human history.",
