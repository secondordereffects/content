  "context": "The shift to remote work accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic was widely celebrated for improving work-life balance. No commute means more time for exercise, better meals, and reduced stress. But population health data tells a different story. Without the incidental movement built into office life — walking to meetings, commuting by foot or bike, taking stairs, grabbing lunch — remote workers experience a dramatic reduction in daily movement. The average office worker takes 6,000-8,000 steps per day including commute. Remote workers average 2,000-3,000. This 60% reduction in baseline movement compounds over months and years into measurable health deterioration that most workers don't notice until symptoms appear.",
