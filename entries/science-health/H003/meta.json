  "context": "Science is built on replication — if a finding is real, other researchers should be able to reproduce it. But when researchers tried to replicate landmark studies across psychology, medicine, and economics, the results were devastating. 50-70% of studies failed to replicate. The causes are systemic: publish-or-perish incentives, p-hacking, small sample sizes, and journals that only publish positive results. The replication crisis doesn't just affect academia — it undermines public trust in science at a time when that trust is desperately needed.",
