  "context": "The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telemedicine adoption by a decade. Virtual visits went from 1% to 40% of outpatient encounters almost overnight. Regulatory barriers fell — interstate licensing, prescribing restrictions, reimbursement parity. The access gains were real: rural patients could see specialists, chronically ill patients avoided dangerous waiting rooms, mental health services reached underserved populations. But telemedicine also introduced systematic quality tradeoffs. Physical examination is impossible over video. Subtle diagnostic cues — skin color, gait, affect — are lost through a screen. Doctors report higher rates of diagnostic uncertainty in virtual visits. Antibiotic and controlled substance prescribing increased as doctors, unable to examine patients, defaulted to treatment over watchful waiting. The convenience that improved access also created a two-tier system: complex cases still require in-person visits, but patients now expect the convenience of virtual care for everything.",
