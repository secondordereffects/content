  "context": "Public health agencies respond to vaccine hesitancy by providing more information — fact sheets, debunking campaigns, social media counter-messaging. The assumption is that hesitancy stems from ignorance, and information corrects ignorance. But research consistently shows that more information often increases hesitancy rather than reducing it. Debunking myths reinforces them through the familiarity backfire effect. Detailed risk disclosures — required by law — give hesitant individuals specific fears to anchor on. And the information environment itself has changed: every fact sheet competes with thousands of emotionally compelling anti-vaccine narratives optimized for engagement. The information approach fails because hesitancy is primarily emotional and social, not informational.",
