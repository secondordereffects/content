  "context": "AI systems make consequential decisions — who gets a loan, who gets hired, who gets parole, what medical treatment is recommended. When these decisions go wrong, a familiar pattern emerges: the company blames the algorithm, the algorithm can't be interrogated, and the affected person has no recourse. The AI accountability gap is the space between 'the AI decided' and 'someone is responsible.' It's growing wider as AI systems become more autonomous and more opaque.",
