  "context": "AI labs compete fiercely on benchmark leaderboards. MMLU, HumanEval, GSM8K, HellaSwag — these scores drive funding, media coverage, and customer adoption. The incentive to score well is enormous. But Goodhart's Law applies with full force: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Labs optimize specifically for benchmark performance through training data contamination (benchmarks leak into training sets), prompt engineering tuned to benchmark formats, and architectural choices that trade real-world capability for benchmark scores. Models that top leaderboards frequently underperform in production on tasks that don't match benchmark formats. The benchmarks that were supposed to measure AI progress now measure how well labs game benchmarks.",
