  "context": "Companies raise billions to build proprietary AI models, claiming their model is their moat. But the AI landscape commoditizes faster than any technology in history. Open-source models close the gap within months. Fine-tuning makes generic models competitive with specialized ones. The cost of training drops exponentially. What was a $100M advantage in January is a commodity by December. The moat isn't the model — it never was.",
