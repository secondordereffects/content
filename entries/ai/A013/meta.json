  "context": "Companies deploy AI chatbots to handle customer support at scale. The math is compelling: a chatbot costs pennies per interaction versus $5-15 for a human agent. First-line resolution rates look good — 60-70% of queries handled without human escalation. But the 30-40% that need a human now face longer queues because the company cut human staff. And the chatbot's confident-but-wrong answers create new support tickets. Customer satisfaction drops. The customers who matter most — high-value, complex-problem customers — are the ones most frustrated.",
