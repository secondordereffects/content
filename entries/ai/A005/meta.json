  "context": "As LLMs became mainstream, 'prompt engineering' emerged as a hot skill. Job postings appeared. Courses launched. People built careers around crafting the perfect prompt. But models improve with every release — techniques that worked on GPT-3.5 are unnecessary on GPT-4, and irrelevant on GPT-5. The skill has a half-life measured in months, not years. The better the models get, the less prompt engineering matters.",
