  "context": "AI-generated images, audio, and video have become indistinguishable from real media. Anyone with a laptop can create a convincing video of anyone saying anything. The first-order concern is misinformation — fake videos of politicians, fabricated evidence, scam calls using cloned voices. But the deeper second-order effect is worse: when anything can be faked, nothing can be trusted. Real evidence gets dismissed as 'probably AI.' The liar's dividend — guilty parties claim authentic evidence is fabricated — becomes the default defense.",
