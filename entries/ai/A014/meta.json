  "context": "AI-powered recommendation engines now mediate what billions of people see, read, watch, and buy. Netflix, TikTok, YouTube, Spotify, Amazon, and Google all use deep learning to personalize content feeds. The pitch is compelling: show people more of what they like, less of what they don't. But personalization algorithms optimize for engagement, not for breadth. They learn your preferences and then narrow your world to match them. Over time, users exist inside increasingly tight information bubbles where their existing beliefs are reinforced, their tastes calcify, and their exposure to challenging or novel ideas shrinks. The filter bubble isn't a bug — it's the inevitable output of optimizing for click-through rates on a per-user basis.",
