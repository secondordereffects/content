  "context": "Generative AI models are trained on billions of copyrighted works — books, articles, images, code, music — without permission or compensation. The outputs are 'new' works that are statistically derived from the training data. Legal systems worldwide are struggling to answer fundamental questions: Is training on copyrighted data fair use? Who owns AI-generated output? Can AI output infringe copyright if it's 'original'? While courts deliberate, the AI industry is building a multi-trillion dollar ecosystem on a legal foundation that may not hold.",
