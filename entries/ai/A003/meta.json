  "context": "Every wave of automation triggers the same debate: will machines take our jobs? Economists point to history — the industrial revolution, ATMs, spreadsheets — and argue that automation creates more jobs than it destroys. This is true in aggregate and over decades. But the lag between job destruction and job creation can be 10-20 years, concentrated in specific regions and demographics. The people who lose jobs are rarely the people who get the new ones.",
