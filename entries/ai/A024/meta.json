  "context": "Thousands of startups and enterprises have built their core products on top of OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google AI APIs. The integration is fast, the capabilities are impressive, and the alternative — training your own models — costs millions. But this creates a dependency pattern that would terrify any infrastructure engineer if it were a database or cloud provider. A single API provider controls your model quality, pricing, rate limits, content policy, and uptime. When OpenAI has an outage, entire product categories go dark simultaneously. When they change their content filtering, products break without warning. When they raise prices, your unit economics shift overnight. The AI API layer has become the most concentrated single point of failure in modern software, and most companies have no fallback.",
