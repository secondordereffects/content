  "context": "Voice AI systems — from customer service bots to AI companions — are approaching human-like fluency. They handle tone, pacing, and even emotional inflection. Companies deploy them to reduce call center costs by 60-80%. But as voice AI gets closer to human without being human, it enters the uncanny valley. Users feel uneasy when they can't tell if they're talking to a person or a machine. Trust erodes when the deception is revealed. Elderly and vulnerable populations are particularly susceptible to manipulation by convincing voice AI. The technology also enables voice cloning for fraud — a 3-second audio sample is enough to clone a voice convincingly. The same capability that makes customer service cheaper makes social engineering attacks dramatically more effective.",
