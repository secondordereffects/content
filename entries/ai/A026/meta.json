  "context": "AI tutoring systems promise personalized education at scale — every student gets a patient, always-available tutor. Early results look promising: students complete assignments faster and report higher satisfaction. But a deeper pattern emerges. Students who rely on AI tutors develop learned helplessness — they can solve problems with AI assistance but can't solve them independently. The AI becomes a cognitive crutch that prevents the productive struggle necessary for genuine learning.",
