  "context": "Generative AI image tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion have made visual content creation nearly free and instant. Stock photography revenue has cratered. Freelance illustration rates have dropped 30-50%. But the deeper effect is a fundamental shift in how society values visual art. When anyone can generate a photorealistic image in seconds, the perceived value of all visual work — including human-created art — collapses. Art schools report declining enrollment. Professional illustrators pivot to AI-assisted workflows or leave the field. The irony: AI art models were trained on the very human art they're now devaluing, creating a feedback loop where the training data source dries up.",
