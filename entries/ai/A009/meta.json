  "context": "AI agents that can browse the web, write code, send emails, and execute multi-step workflows are being deployed across enterprises. The promise: autonomous task completion that frees humans for higher-level work. The reality: agents make confident mistakes, take irreversible actions, and operate in ways that are difficult to audit. The trust required to let an agent act autonomously is far higher than the trust required to use a chatbot, and current systems haven't earned it.",
