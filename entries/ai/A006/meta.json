  "context": "Governments worldwide are racing to regulate AI. The EU AI Act, US executive orders, and China's generative AI rules all aim to prevent harm from artificial intelligence. The logic is intuitive: powerful technology needs guardrails. But AI regulation faces a structural paradox. The compliance burden falls disproportionately on smaller companies and open-source projects that lack legal teams and regulatory infrastructure. Meanwhile, the largest AI labs — the ones with the most dangerous capabilities — can absorb compliance costs as a competitive moat. Regulation designed to make AI safer may instead concentrate AI power among a handful of well-resourced incumbents while pushing innovation underground or offshore to jurisdictions with no oversight at all.",
