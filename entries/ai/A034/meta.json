  "context": "As AI-generated content floods the internet, watermarking is proposed as the solution — embed invisible signals in AI outputs so they can be detected later. Google's SynthID, OpenAI's text watermarking, and C2PA metadata standards all aim to make AI content identifiable. The logic seems sound: if we can detect AI content, we can maintain trust. But watermarking creates an arms race. Every watermarking technique can be defeated — paraphrasing removes text watermarks, image editing strips visual watermarks, and metadata can be stripped or forged. Worse, watermarking only works if all AI providers implement it, and open-source models have no obligation to do so. The arms race consumes engineering resources on both sides while providing a false sense of security that AI content is being tracked.",
