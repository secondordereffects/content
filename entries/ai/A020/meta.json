  "context": "Real-time AI translation tools like Google Translate, DeepL, and GPT-powered translators promise to break language barriers across business, travel, and diplomacy. Adoption is accelerating — over 500 million daily users across major platforms. But translation is not just word substitution; it encodes cultural context, humor, formality registers, and power dynamics. As AI translation becomes the default interface between cultures, it systematically strips these layers, producing fluent but culturally flat output. The result is a slow homogenization where nuance, idiom, and culturally specific reasoning patterns are replaced by a lingua franca optimized for clarity over meaning. Languages with smaller training corpora suffer disproportionately, accelerating their marginalization.",
