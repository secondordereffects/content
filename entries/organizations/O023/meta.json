  "context": "Organizations adopt Slack, Teams, or similar tools to replace email and reduce meetings. The promise: async communication that respects everyone's time. The reality: a firehose of messages that creates a new kind of always-on anxiety. The green dot becomes a surveillance signal. Channels multiply until nobody can keep up. And the 'async' tool becomes synchronous — people expect immediate responses, creating a more demanding communication environment than email ever was.",
