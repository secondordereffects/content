  "context": "Outsourcing non-core functions is a staple of business strategy. The logic is clean: focus on what you do best, let specialists handle the rest, and save 30-50% on labor costs. IT, customer support, manufacturing, accounting — all candidates for outsourcing. The cost savings are real and immediate. But outsourcing creates a slow-moving knowledge drain that doesn't show up on the balance sheet for years. When you outsource a function, you lose the institutional knowledge of how it works. The vendor becomes the expert. Over time, you can't evaluate whether the vendor is doing a good job because you no longer understand the work. You can't bring it back in-house because the knowledge has left the building. The vendor knows this, and pricing reflects your dependency.",
