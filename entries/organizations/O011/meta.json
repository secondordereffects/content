  "context": "Companies tear down walls and cubicles to create open floor plans. The stated goal: more collaboration, more spontaneous interaction, more innovation. The actual result: employees put on headphones, avoid eye contact, and communicate less face-to-face than they did with walls. The open office doesn't increase collaboration — it destroys the conditions that make collaboration productive: focus, privacy, and the ability to think without interruption.",
