  "context": "Organizations use meetings to ensure alignment, make decisions, and share information. As the company grows, meetings multiply. Each meeting spawns pre-meetings, follow-up meetings, and status update meetings. Calendars fill until there's no time left for the work being discussed in the meetings. The average knowledge worker now spends 60-70% of their time in meetings, leaving 2-3 hours of fragmented time for actual productive work.",
