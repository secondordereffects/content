  "context": "Leadership mandates that all teams use the internal platform — internal auth system, internal deployment pipeline, internal monitoring stack. The rationale is consistency: one way to do things reduces cognitive load and enables shared tooling. But mandates without market feedback create captive customers. The internal platform team has no competitive pressure to improve. Product teams can't choose better alternatives. Feature requests go into a backlog that's prioritized by the platform team's roadmap, not by product team urgency. Teams that could ship in days using off-the-shelf tools wait weeks for internal platform features. The mandate creates resentment, shadow IT, and a growing gap between what the platform provides and what teams actually need.",
