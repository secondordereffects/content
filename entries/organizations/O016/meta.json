  "context": "Corporate acquisitions are pitched as growth accelerators. Buy a company, integrate their product, cross-sell to your customer base, and capture synergies. The M&A playbook is taught in every business school. What isn't taught is the 70-90% failure rate. The integration process systematically destroys the very things that made the acquired company valuable: its culture, its speed, its talent, and its product vision. Key employees leave within 18 months (often the ones the acquirer most wanted to retain). The product gets absorbed into the parent's roadmap and loses its identity. Customers who chose the acquired product for its independence start looking for alternatives. The acquirer paid a premium for a living organism and then killed it during the transplant.",
