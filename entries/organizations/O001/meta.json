  "context": "The post-pandemic remote work revolution promised flexibility, reduced commutes, and access to global talent. Companies embraced distributed teams, closed offices, and hired across time zones. Productivity metrics initially looked great — individual output increased. But coordination costs were quietly compounding. Synchronous overlap windows shrank as teams spanned more time zones. Decisions that took a 5-minute hallway conversation now required scheduling a meeting 3 days out. Context was lost in async handoffs. New hires took 2x longer to onboard without osmotic learning. The coordination tax wasn't visible in any dashboard, but it showed up in slower shipping velocity, more misaligned work, and a growing sense that everyone was busy but nothing was moving.",
