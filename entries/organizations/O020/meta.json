  "context": "In many tech companies, promotion to senior or staff engineer requires demonstrating 'impact' through large-scale technical projects. The incentive is clear: build something big, get promoted. But this creates a systematic bias toward complexity. Engineers propose microservice decompositions, platform rewrites, and new infrastructure not because the business needs them, but because they're promotion-worthy projects. A simple solution that works doesn't get you promoted; a complex solution that requires a team does. The architecture of the system becomes a reflection of the promotion criteria, not the business requirements. Google engineers coined the term 'promo-driven development' to describe this pattern. The result is over-engineered systems that serve career advancement more than customer needs.",
