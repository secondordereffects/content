  "context": "Companies promote internal mobility programs to retain talent and reduce hiring costs. HR builds internal job boards, encourages cross-team transfers, and celebrates internal moves as career development. But the system creates perverse incentives at the manager level. Managers who invest in developing employees lose them to other teams. High performers become targets for internal poaching. Managers respond by hoarding talent, blocking transfers, or stopping investment in employee growth. The program designed to retain talent at the company level destroys talent development at the team level.",
