  "context": "Annual performance reviews are supposed to drive performance — set expectations, provide feedback, calibrate compensation. But the annual review cycle creates a persistent anxiety tax on the organization. For weeks before reviews, productivity drops as employees curate their self-assessments, managers write reviews, and calibration meetings consume leadership time. The review itself is a high-stakes, low-information event: a year of work compressed into a rating that determines compensation and career trajectory. Recency bias dominates — the last 2 months matter more than the first 10. Employees optimize for review visibility rather than actual impact. The anxiety peaks during calibration, where managers horse-trade ratings in a zero-sum game. The process that was supposed to improve performance instead creates a quarterly cycle of anxiety, political behavior, and productivity loss.",
