  "context": "OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) promise alignment — everyone knows what matters and how to measure progress. Google popularized them, so they must work. But OKRs are subject to Goodhart's Law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Teams optimize for the key result metric rather than the objective it was supposed to represent. 'Increase user engagement' becomes 'increase time on site' which becomes dark patterns that trap users. 'Improve code quality' becomes 'increase test coverage' which becomes meaningless tests that cover lines without testing behavior. The quarterly OKR cycle creates a planning tax — weeks spent negotiating targets, mid-quarter check-ins, end-of-quarter reviews — that consumes 10-15% of productive time. And because OKRs are public, teams sandbag targets to ensure they hit 70%, the magic number that signals 'ambitious but achievable.'",
