  "context": "Companies implement forced ranking (stack ranking) to identify top performers and manage out low performers. Every review cycle, managers must rank employees on a curve — a fixed percentage get top ratings, a fixed percentage get bottom ratings. The system was popularized by Jack Welch at GE and adopted across tech. The result: employees compete against each other instead of against the market. Collaboration dies because helping a colleague succeed means you rank lower. The system optimizes for individual performance metrics while destroying the teamwork that actually drives organizational success.",
