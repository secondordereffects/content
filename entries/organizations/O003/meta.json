  "context": "Companies adopt flat organizational structures to empower employees, reduce bureaucracy, and speed up decision-making. No managers, no titles, everyone is equal. Valve, GitHub (early), and Zappos (Holacracy) were poster children. But removing formal hierarchy doesn't eliminate hierarchy — it makes it invisible. Shadow hierarchies emerge based on social capital, tenure, charisma, and access to founders. These informal power structures are harder to navigate than formal ones because the rules are unwritten. New employees can't read an org chart to understand who has influence. Marginalized groups, who benefit most from formal structures that create clear paths to advancement, are disproportionately disadvantaged. The flat org doesn't eliminate power — it just makes power unaccountable.",
