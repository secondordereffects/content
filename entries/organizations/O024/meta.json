  "context": "Companies adopt four-day work weeks promising better work-life balance and equal productivity. Early trials show promising results — employees report higher satisfaction and output per hour increases. But the mechanism behind maintaining output in fewer hours is often intensity compression: meetings get shorter but more packed, breaks disappear, lunch becomes optional, and the social fabric of work erodes. Employees trade one form of burnout (long hours) for another (relentless intensity). The extra day off becomes recovery from the compressed four days rather than genuine leisure.",
