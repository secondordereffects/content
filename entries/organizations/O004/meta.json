  "context": "Companies adopt the mantra 'only hire the best' and raise the hiring bar continuously. Each new hire must be better than the average of the existing team. Interview processes expand to 5-8 rounds. Take-home projects consume 10-20 hours. The bar rises until it filters out qualified candidates who could do the job well but don't perform optimally in artificial interview conditions. The process selects for interview skills, not job skills. Meanwhile, positions stay open for months, existing team members burn out covering the gap, and the company loses candidates to competitors with faster processes. The irony: the 'best' candidates — those with multiple offers — are the ones most likely to drop out of a lengthy process. The hiring bar that was supposed to ensure quality actually selects for candidates who have the luxury of time and the specific skill of interviewing well.",
