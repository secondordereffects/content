  "context": "With the shift to remote work, companies deploy employee monitoring software — keystroke loggers, screenshot capture, mouse movement tracking, application usage monitoring. The stated goal: ensure remote workers are productive. The actual result: employees optimize for appearing busy rather than being productive. They jiggle their mouse, keep apps open, and perform visible-but-meaningless work. Trust collapses. The best employees leave for companies that treat them like adults. Surveillance doesn't measure productivity — it measures compliance with surveillance.",
