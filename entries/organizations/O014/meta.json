  "context": "Consensus-driven decision-making is the default in many organizations, especially in tech. The logic is appealing: get everyone's input, ensure buy-in, make better decisions through diverse perspectives. In practice, consensus requirements create decision paralysis. Every stakeholder has veto power. Meetings multiply as groups try to align. Decisions get watered down to the lowest common denominator that nobody objects to but nobody is excited about. The most important decisions — the ones that require bold tradeoffs — are exactly the ones consensus can't produce, because bold tradeoffs create losers, and consensus requires that nobody loses. Organizations that optimize for consensus optimize for mediocrity and speed-to-nothing.",
