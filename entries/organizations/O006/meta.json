  "context": "Companies hire for 'culture fit' to build cohesive teams and reduce friction. The intent is reasonable — teams that share values and communication styles work together more smoothly. But 'culture fit' is often a proxy for demographic and cognitive similarity. Interviewers unconsciously select candidates who look, think, and communicate like themselves. Over time, the organization becomes increasingly homogeneous. Dissenting viewpoints disappear. Groupthink sets in. The company loses the cognitive diversity needed to spot blind spots, challenge assumptions, and innovate. The very cohesion that culture fit creates becomes a vulnerability — the team agrees quickly but agrees on the wrong things.",
