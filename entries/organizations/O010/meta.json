  "context": "Large organizations reorganize frequently — the average Fortune 500 company undergoes a major reorg every 2-3 years. The stated goals are always rational: align teams to strategy, reduce silos, improve efficiency, flatten hierarchy. Leadership models the reorg on an org chart and announces it in an all-hands. What they don't model is the 6-12 month productivity crater that follows. Every reorg resets institutional knowledge networks, breaks informal communication channels, triggers political jockeying for new positions, and forces employees into a survival mode where they optimize for visibility over output. Studies consistently show that reorganizations destroy 20-40% of productive capacity for 6+ months, and most never achieve their stated efficiency goals.",
