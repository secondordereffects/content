  "context": "Organizations adopt Agile (usually Scrum) to move faster. Initially it works — small teams, short cycles, rapid feedback. Then the organization scales. More teams mean more coordination. Coordination means more ceremonies. Stand-ups, sprint planning, backlog grooming, retrospectives, PI planning, scrum-of-scrums, demo days. What started as a lightweight process becomes a calendar-consuming bureaucracy that leaves less time for actual building.",
