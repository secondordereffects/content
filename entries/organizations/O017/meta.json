  "context": "Organizations launch DEI programs after social pressure events, hiring dedicated staff, mandating training, and setting representation targets. Initial momentum is high. But implementation often prioritizes visible metrics over systemic change. Mandatory training triggers reactance in employees who feel accused. Representation targets create perceptions of lowered standards. The programs generate backlash that entrenches the very attitudes they aimed to change, creating a cycle where each initiative produces counter-reaction, leading to program rollback and organizational cynicism about future efforts.",
