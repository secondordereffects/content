  "context": "Startup founders who stay deeply hands-on — reviewing every PR, attending every customer call, making every product decision — often build exceptional early-stage companies. This 'founder mode' creates speed, coherence, and quality that professional managers can't match. But it doesn't scale. At 30-50 employees, the founder becomes the bottleneck. Every decision waits for their input. Talented leaders leave because they have no real authority. The organization develops learned helplessness — nobody makes decisions because the founder might override them. The very quality that made the company successful becomes the thing that prevents it from growing. Paul Graham's 2024 essay popularized the term, but the pattern has been destroying companies for decades.",
