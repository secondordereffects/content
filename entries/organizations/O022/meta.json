  "context": "Post-pandemic, executives mandate return-to-office (RTO) policies citing collaboration, culture, and productivity. Employees return to offices designed for pre-pandemic work patterns. What follows is a cascade of second-order effects that often undermine the stated goals. Top performers with the most options leave first. Those who stay spend their office days on Zoom calls in open-plan spaces, commuting 1-2 hours for the privilege. Desk utilization hovers at 40-60% while companies pay for peak capacity. The collaboration that RTO was supposed to restore doesn't materialize because teams are still distributed across locations and time zones.",
