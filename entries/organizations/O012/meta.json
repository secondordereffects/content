  "context": "Companies replace fixed vacation policies with 'unlimited PTO' — take as much time as you need. It sounds generous. In practice, employees take less vacation, not more. Without a defined entitlement, there's no anchor. Nobody wants to be the person who takes 'too much.' Managers don't model healthy usage. The company saves money on accrued vacation liability while employees burn out faster.",
