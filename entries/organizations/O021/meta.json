  "context": "Organizations invest in documentation to ensure knowledge transfer, reduce bus factor, and onboard new team members faster. The initial documentation push produces comprehensive wikis, runbooks, and architecture decision records. But documentation has a half-life. Code changes but docs don't. APIs evolve but their docs stay frozen. Within 6 months, 30-40% of technical documentation is outdated. Within a year, it's over 50%. The problem compounds: once developers encounter outdated docs a few times, they stop trusting all documentation. They go straight to the code or ask a colleague. The documentation investment becomes a liability — worse than no docs, because outdated docs actively mislead. The team that was supposed to benefit from documentation now spends time debugging issues caused by following stale instructions.",
