  "context": "Teams adopt observability platforms (Datadog, New Relic, Splunk) to understand their distributed systems. The pitch: instrument everything, collect all the data, and you'll be able to debug any issue. So they do. Every service emits metrics, traces, and logs. The data volume explodes. The observability bill becomes one of the largest line items in the infrastructure budget — sometimes exceeding the cost of the infrastructure being observed. And despite all this data, teams still can't find the needle in the haystack when production breaks.",
