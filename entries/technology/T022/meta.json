  "context": "Teams adopt Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation) to make infrastructure reproducible, version-controlled, and auditable. The initial setup is clean. Then someone makes a manual change in the console during an incident. Then another. Then a new service gets provisioned outside IaC because it was 'just a quick test.' Drift accumulates. The IaC state file says one thing, reality says another. The reproducible infrastructure is no longer reproducible, and nobody knows which version is correct.",
