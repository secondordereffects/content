  "context": "Dark mode became a must-have feature after iOS and Android added system-wide dark themes. Users love it — it feels modern, reduces eye strain in low light, and saves battery on OLED screens. Product teams rush to implement it. But dark mode doubles the design surface area. Every color, every contrast ratio, every component state needs to work in both themes. Teams that carefully tuned their light mode for WCAG AA contrast ratios often ship dark modes that fail accessibility standards. Low-contrast text on dark backgrounds, insufficient focus indicators, images with transparent backgrounds that disappear, and status colors that lose meaning against dark surfaces. The feature that was supposed to improve comfort creates accessibility regressions for the users who need good contrast most.",
