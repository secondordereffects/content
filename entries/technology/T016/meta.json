  "context": "Blockchain technology solves a specific, narrow problem: trustless consensus among parties who don't trust each other and can't rely on a central authority. That's it. But the hype cycle turned blockchain into a hammer looking for nails. Supply chain tracking, voting systems, medical records, real estate, identity management — all proposed as blockchain use cases despite having trusted intermediaries that work fine. The result is billions of dollars invested in blockchain solutions that are slower, more expensive, and harder to maintain than the centralized databases they replaced. Most enterprise blockchain projects quietly shut down within 2-3 years when the team realizes that a PostgreSQL database with access controls solves the same problem at 1/100th the cost and complexity.",
