  "context": "Zero trust security — 'never trust, always verify' — replaces the traditional perimeter model where everything inside the network is trusted. The concept is sound: assume breach, verify every request, enforce least privilege. But implementing zero trust in an existing organization is a multi-year, multi-million dollar undertaking. Every service needs identity-aware access. Every network flow needs policy enforcement. Every legacy application needs retrofitting. Developer productivity drops as authentication and authorization checks multiply. The security team becomes a bottleneck as every new service requires policy configuration. Organizations often implement zero trust partially — adding friction without completing the security model — creating the worst of both worlds: slower development with incomplete protection.",
