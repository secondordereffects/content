  "context": "A codebase has accumulated years of technical debt, inconsistent patterns, and legacy decisions. The team is frustrated. Someone proposes the solution that feels obvious: rewrite it from scratch. Clean slate. Modern stack. Do it right this time. Leadership approves. The rewrite begins with optimism and ends — if it ends at all — years later, over budget, with a new system that has its own set of problems and has lost years of battle-tested edge case handling.",
