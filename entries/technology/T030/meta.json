  "context": "Companies pursue SOC 2, ISO 27001, and other security certifications to win enterprise deals and demonstrate security maturity. The compliance process requires documenting policies, implementing controls, and passing audits. But compliance and security are different things. SOC 2 audits check that you have policies and follow them — not that your policies are good. Companies pass audits with checkbox controls that don't meaningfully improve security. Password rotation policies that lead to weaker passwords. Access reviews that rubber-stamp existing permissions. Vulnerability scans that produce reports nobody reads. The compliance process consumes 3-6 months of engineering time annually while creating a false sense of security. The badge on the website says 'SOC 2 Type II' but the actual security posture may be unchanged.",
