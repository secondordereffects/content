  "context": "Tech companies use algorithmic coding challenges (LeetCode-style problems) as the primary filter for engineering hires. The practice started at Google and spread industry-wide. Candidates spend months grinding algorithm problems that have no relationship to their daily work. Companies filter out experienced engineers who can't reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard while hiring puzzle-solvers who can't design a production system. The interview process selects for interview preparation skill, not engineering ability.",
