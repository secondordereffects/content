  "context": "Teams plan incremental migrations — move from monolith to microservices, from REST to GraphQL, from one database to another — one piece at a time. The plan sounds responsible: reduce risk by migrating gradually. But incremental migrations create a prolonged state where both old and new systems coexist. This halfway house is the worst of both worlds. Engineers must understand and maintain two systems. Data flows through compatibility layers that add latency and bugs. New features must work in both paradigms. The migration stalls at 60-70% completion because the remaining 30% is the hardest, least-rewarding work. The organization lives in the halfway house for years, paying the tax of dual systems while getting the benefits of neither.",
