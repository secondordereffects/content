  "context": "Teams automate everything in the CI/CD pipeline — linting, testing, security scanning, dependency checks, container builds, deployments, notifications. Each addition seems reasonable. But pipelines accumulate steps over years without pruning. A pipeline that took 5 minutes in year one takes 45 minutes in year three. Flaky tests that fail 2% of the time become blockers when you have 500 tests. Security scanners produce hundreds of findings that nobody triages. The pipeline becomes the bottleneck it was designed to eliminate. Developers start working around it — pushing directly to main, skipping checks, batching changes to avoid waiting. The automation that was supposed to increase confidence becomes a tax on velocity that teams actively circumvent.",
