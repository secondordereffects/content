  "context": "Companies open-source their internal tools to build community, attract talent, and establish technical credibility. The launch gets stars, blog posts, and conference talks. But open-source maintenance is a permanent commitment that most organizations underestimate. Issues pile up. PRs from external contributors need review. Security vulnerabilities need patching. Documentation needs updating. The maintainers — usually the original authors — burn out within 1-2 years. The project enters a zombie state: too popular to abandon, too costly to maintain. Meanwhile, the company's internal fork diverges from the open-source version, creating two codebases to maintain. The community that was supposed to contribute becomes a support burden, filing issues faster than the team can triage them.",
