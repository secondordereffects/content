  "context": "Engineering teams adopt managed cloud services to move faster. The first service is a pragmatic choice — why build a message queue when SQS exists? Then comes DynamoDB because it integrates neatly. Then Lambda because it's serverless. Then Step Functions for orchestration. Each decision is locally rational. But the cumulative effect is a system so deeply coupled to one provider that migration becomes a multi-year, multi-million dollar project. The lock-in doesn't happen in one decision — it's a gradient, each step making the next proprietary choice easier and the exit harder.",
