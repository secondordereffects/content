  "context": "Low-code and no-code platforms (Retool, Bubble, OutSystems, Mendix, Appsmith) promise to democratize software development. Business users build apps without engineers. Internal tools ship in days instead of months. The productivity gains are real — for the first 6-12 months. Then the walls close in. The platform's abstraction layer that made building fast now makes customization impossible. Business logic lives in a proprietary visual editor with no version control, no code review, no testing framework, and no export path. When you outgrow the platform — and you will — you face a total rewrite because nothing you built is portable. The low-code platform didn't eliminate engineering complexity. It deferred it while adding vendor lock-in.",
