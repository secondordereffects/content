  "context": "Modern software is built on towers of dependencies. A typical Node.js project has 500-1,500 transitive dependencies. A Python project has 50-200. Each dependency is maintained by someone else — often a single unpaid volunteer. The left-pad incident (2016), the log4j vulnerability (2021), and the xz backdoor (2024) all demonstrated the same structural fragility: critical infrastructure depends on code maintained by strangers with no obligation to keep it working or secure. Dependencies decay silently. Maintainers burn out, abandon projects, or introduce vulnerabilities. By the time you notice, the rot has spread through your entire dependency tree. The convenience of 'just npm install it' creates a supply chain that nobody owns and everybody depends on.",
