  "context": "Organizations create platform engineering teams to build internal developer platforms — golden paths for deployment, standardized tooling, self-service infrastructure. The goal is to accelerate product teams by abstracting away infrastructure complexity. But platform teams face a fundamental tension: they're building a product for internal customers who can't leave. Without market pressure, platform teams build what they think developers need rather than what developers actually need. The platform becomes opinionated in ways that don't match real workflows. Product teams work around the platform rather than through it. The platform team grows to 10-15% of engineering headcount, consuming resources that could ship customer-facing features. The abstraction that was supposed to simplify becomes another layer of complexity that developers must learn and navigate.",
