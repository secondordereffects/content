  "context": "Multi-cloud strategy sounds like good risk management. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Run workloads across AWS, GCP, and Azure so no single provider can hold you hostage. The CTO presents it to the board as a vendor lock-in mitigation strategy. In practice, multi-cloud multiplies every operational challenge by the number of clouds. Each provider has different networking models, IAM systems, storage APIs, monitoring tools, and pricing structures. Your team must become expert in all of them simultaneously. The lowest-common-denominator approach — abstracting away cloud-specific features — means you pay premium prices for commodity capabilities while losing the managed services that justify cloud adoption in the first place. Most companies that attempt multi-cloud end up with one primary cloud and expensive, underutilized secondary deployments.",
