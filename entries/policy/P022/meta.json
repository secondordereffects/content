  "context": "Regulators mandate disclosure requirements — financial reports, privacy policies, terms of service, ingredient labels, risk warnings — believing transparency empowers informed decisions. The volume of mandatory disclosures has grown exponentially. But humans have finite attention. When everything must be disclosed, nothing is effectively communicated. Companies comply with the letter of disclosure laws while burying meaningful information in hundreds of pages of boilerplate. The disclosure regime creates an illusion of transparency that actually reduces accountability, because companies can claim they disclosed risks that no reasonable person would have found or understood.",
