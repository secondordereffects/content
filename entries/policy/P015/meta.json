  "context": "The EU AI Act, effective 2024, is the world's first comprehensive AI regulation framework. It classifies AI systems by risk level and imposes requirements ranging from transparency obligations to outright bans. The intent is laudable — prevent AI harms before they occur. But regulation of a fast-moving technology creates a chilling effect on innovation. European AI startups face compliance costs that US and Chinese competitors don't. Large language model developers must navigate complex classification systems. The definition of 'high-risk AI' is broad enough to capture many beneficial applications. Companies choose to launch in the US first, or skip the EU entirely. The Brussels Effect — where EU regulation becomes global standard — may export compliance costs worldwide, but it may also export innovation suppression.",
