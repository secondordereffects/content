  "context": "Cities facing housing affordability crises implement rent control to protect tenants from rising costs. The policy delivers immediate relief to current renters. But it simultaneously destroys the economic incentive to build new housing, maintain existing units, or enter the rental market. Over 5-15 years, the housing supply shrinks, quality deteriorates, and the affordability crisis deepens for everyone not already locked into a controlled unit.",

  "hypothesis": "Rent control makes housing more affordable and protects tenants from displacement.",
