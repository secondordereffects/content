  "context": "Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shields platforms from liability for user-generated content. Critics from both political sides want it repealed or reformed — the left says it enables hate speech and misinformation, the right says it enables censorship. But Section 230 doesn't just protect Big Tech. It protects every website with a comment section, every forum, every review site, every small social platform. Repealing it wouldn't hurt Facebook — they can afford lawyers. It would kill the open internet.",
