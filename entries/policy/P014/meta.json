  "context": "Countries increasingly require that citizen data be stored within national borders — India's data localization rules, China's Cybersecurity Law, Russia's Federal Law 242, the EU's evolving data sovereignty framework. The rationale is sovereignty and security: governments want jurisdiction over their citizens' data. But data localization fragments the global internet. Companies must build redundant infrastructure in every jurisdiction. Startups face prohibitive compliance costs. Cloud providers must build local data centers, passing costs to customers. Cross-border services become legally complex. The internet, designed as a borderless network, is being carved into national data territories. The irony: localization often doesn't improve security (local data centers can be less secure than global cloud providers) and creates new attack surfaces through data replication.",
