  "context": "Countries restrict immigration to protect domestic workers from wage competition and preserve cultural cohesion. The first-order logic is straightforward: fewer immigrants means less labor supply competition. But the second-order effects run in the opposite direction. Skilled immigrants disproportionately start companies, file patents, and fill critical STEM gaps. Restricting them doesn't protect domestic workers — it pushes entire industries offshore. Companies that can't hire talent domestically open offices in countries that welcome it. The talent doesn't disappear; it relocates, taking jobs, tax revenue, and innovation ecosystems with it.",
