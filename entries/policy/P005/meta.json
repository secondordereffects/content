  "context": "Platforms deploy content moderation to reduce harmful content — hate speech, misinformation, harassment, CSAM. The intent is clear. The execution creates a cascade of second-order effects. Moderation at scale requires AI systems that make millions of decisions per day with imperfect accuracy. False positives silence legitimate speech. False negatives let harmful content through. Bad actors adapt faster than moderation systems can evolve. And the humans reviewing the worst content develop PTSD at alarming rates.",
