  "context": "Governments reclassify gig workers as employees to provide benefits — health insurance, minimum wage, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation. The intent is protection: gig workers are vulnerable to exploitation. California's AB5, the EU's Platform Work Directive, and UK court rulings all push toward employee classification. But reclassification creates cascading effects. Platforms respond by reducing worker flexibility — the very thing that attracted workers to gig work. Algorithms schedule shifts rather than letting workers choose. Some platforms exit markets entirely rather than comply. Workers who valued flexibility over benefits find themselves with neither. The workers who most need protection — those doing gig work as a primary income — may benefit, but the majority who gig for supplemental income lose the flexibility that made it worthwhile.",
