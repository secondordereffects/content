  "context": "Governments propose student loan forgiveness to address the $1.7T student debt crisis. The immediate relief is real — millions of borrowers freed from crushing payments. But forgiveness without structural reform creates a moral hazard loop. Universities, knowing loans will be forgiven, have no incentive to control costs. Future students borrow more aggressively expecting forgiveness. Taxpayers who didn't attend college or already repaid loans subsidize the system. And the fundamental problem — tuition inflation outpacing wage growth by 3-4x — remains unaddressed, requiring repeated forgiveness cycles.",
