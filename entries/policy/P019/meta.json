  "context": "Net neutrality rules require ISPs to treat all internet traffic equally. Proponents argue this preserves innovation and prevents gatekeeping. But the debate obscures second-order effects on both sides. With net neutrality, ISPs cannot invest in quality-of-service tiers that could improve latency-sensitive applications like telemedicine and autonomous vehicles. Without it, ISPs create fast lanes that entrench incumbents and raise costs for startups. The binary framing misses the real effect: regardless of which policy wins, the regulatory uncertainty itself freezes infrastructure investment and pushes innovation to the application layer where neither policy applies.",
