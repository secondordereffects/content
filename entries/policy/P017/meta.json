  "context": "Governments deploy surveillance technologies — CCTV networks, facial recognition, license plate readers, phone metadata collection, social media monitoring — with a consistent justification: public safety. After every terrorist attack, mass shooting, or crime wave, surveillance budgets expand. The technology is presented as a tradeoff: sacrifice some privacy for more security. But the ratchet only turns one direction. Surveillance infrastructure deployed for terrorism is repurposed for immigration enforcement, then protest monitoring, then petty crime, then political opposition tracking. The UK has 6 million CCTV cameras for 67 million people. China's social credit system started as a financial trustworthiness tool. The NSA's post-9/11 metadata program expanded far beyond its original scope. Once surveillance infrastructure exists, its use always expands beyond its original justification.",
