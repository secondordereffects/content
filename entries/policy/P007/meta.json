  "context": "Universal Basic Income proposes giving every citizen a regular cash payment with no conditions. Proponents argue it eliminates poverty, reduces bureaucracy, and provides a safety net for automation-displaced workers. Pilot programs in Finland, Kenya, Stockton, and elsewhere show positive results: reduced stress, improved health, modest increases in entrepreneurship. But pilots are fundamentally different from universal programs. When everyone in an economy receives additional income simultaneously, prices adjust. Landlords raise rents knowing tenants have more money. Essential goods and services increase in price. The UBI payment gets partially or fully absorbed by inflation in inelastic markets — housing, healthcare, education. The purchasing power increase is smaller than the nominal payment, and the inflation disproportionately harms those just above the UBI threshold who don't receive it.",
