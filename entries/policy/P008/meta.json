  "context": "Carbon taxes are the economist's preferred tool for reducing emissions. Put a price on carbon, and the market will find the cheapest way to reduce it. The theory is elegant. The second-order effects are not. When one country implements a carbon tax and its trading partners don't, carbon-intensive production doesn't disappear — it relocates to countries without carbon pricing. This is carbon leakage: emissions move, they don't shrink. The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) attempts to fix this by taxing imports based on their carbon content. But CBAM creates its own cascade: trade disputes, compliance complexity for developing nations, potential WTO violations, and a new form of protectionism disguised as climate policy. The carbon tax that was supposed to be simple becomes a geopolitical weapon.",
