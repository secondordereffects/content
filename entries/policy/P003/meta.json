  "context": "Zoning laws restrict what can be built where — single-family zones, height limits, setback requirements, parking minimums. The stated goal is preserving neighborhood character, managing density, and protecting property values. But restrictive zoning is the primary driver of the housing affordability crisis in major cities. By limiting supply in high-demand areas, zoning artificially inflates housing costs. San Francisco, where 38% of land is zoned exclusively for single-family homes, has median home prices above $1.3M. The people zoning claims to protect — existing homeowners — benefit from rising property values. The people it harms — renters, young families, essential workers — are priced out entirely. Zoning has become the most effective mechanism for economic segregation in America, more powerful than any explicit discriminatory policy.",
