  "context": "Governments mandate age verification for online platforms to protect children from harmful content. The goal is straightforward: keep kids off adult sites and social media. But effective age verification requires proving identity, which means collecting government IDs, biometric data, or third-party verification tokens. The system designed to protect children creates a mass surveillance infrastructure that tracks adult browsing habits, creates honeypot databases for hackers, and chills free expression. Adults avoid verified platforms, pushing activity to unverified corners of the internet where children are even less protected.",
