  "context": "Drug decriminalization — removing criminal penalties for personal possession — aims to treat addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal one. Portugal's 2001 decriminalization is the model: drug deaths dropped, HIV infections fell, and treatment uptake increased. Oregon followed in 2020 with Measure 110. But Oregon's experience diverged sharply from Portugal's. Portugal paired decriminalization with massive investment in treatment infrastructure and mandatory referral to dissuasion commissions. Oregon decriminalized without building adequate treatment capacity. The result: open drug use increased, treatment uptake remained low (only 1% of citations led to treatment calls), and public drug markets expanded. Oregon repealed Measure 110 in 2024. The lesson isn't that decriminalization fails — it's that decriminalization without treatment infrastructure displaces the problem from the criminal justice system to the streets.",
