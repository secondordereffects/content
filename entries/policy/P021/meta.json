  "context": "Regulators impose strict rules on cryptocurrency to protect consumers from fraud, money laundering, and market manipulation. The intentions are sound — crypto markets have seen spectacular frauds and billions in consumer losses. But aggressive regulation in one jurisdiction doesn't eliminate crypto activity; it relocates it. Companies move to crypto-friendly jurisdictions (Dubai, Singapore, Switzerland), taking jobs, tax revenue, and regulatory influence with them. The regulating country loses oversight of the very activity it tried to control, while citizens access the same services through offshore platforms with even less consumer protection.",
