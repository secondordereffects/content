  "context": "Minimum wage increases are designed to lift low-income workers out of poverty. The first-order logic is straightforward: higher wages mean more money for workers. But labor economics reveals a threshold effect. When minimum wage crosses the break-even point where automation becomes cheaper than human labor for a given task, businesses don't just absorb the cost — they eliminate the position entirely. Self-checkout kiosks, automated order systems, robotic food preparation, and AI customer service didn't replace workers gradually. They were deployed in waves that correlate with minimum wage increases crossing specific thresholds. The workers most affected are the ones the policy was designed to help: low-skill, entry-level employees who lose not just income but the on-ramp to workforce participation.",
