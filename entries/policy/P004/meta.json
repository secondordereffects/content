  "context": "Right to repair legislation requires manufacturers to provide parts, tools, and documentation for consumers and independent repair shops. The EU, several US states, and other jurisdictions are passing these laws. The consumer benefit is clear: cheaper repairs, longer device lifespans, less e-waste. But manufacturers respond strategically. Apple introduced self-service repair — but the parts cost nearly as much as professional repair, the tools require a $1,200 rental deposit, and the process is deliberately complex. Manufacturers redesign products to be technically repairable but practically unrepairable — parts paired to serial numbers, software locks on replacement components, diagnostic tools withheld. The letter of the law is met while the spirit is defeated. Right to repair becomes right to attempt repair.",

  "hypothesis": "Right to repair empowers consumers to fix their own devices affordably.",
