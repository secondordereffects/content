  "context": "Antitrust regulators propose breaking up big tech companies to increase competition — separate Google Search from Chrome, Instagram from Facebook, AWS from Amazon retail. The logic follows historical precedent: AT&T's breakup created competition in telecom. But digital platforms are fundamentally different from industrial monopolies. Network effects mean that broken-up pieces either recombine (users migrate to the dominant fragment) or each fragment becomes a smaller monopoly in its niche. Breaking up Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp creates three companies that still dominate their respective categories. The data advantages that created the monopoly persist in each fragment. And the breakup process takes 5-10 years of litigation, during which the market evolves past the remedy. By the time Google is broken up, AI may have made search irrelevant.",
