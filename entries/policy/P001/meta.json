  "context": "The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was designed to protect individual privacy and give users control over their data. It succeeded at that. But it also created a massive compliance burden that large companies can absorb and small companies cannot. The regulation intended to constrain Big Tech inadvertently strengthened their position by raising the cost of competing with them. Google and Meta have armies of lawyers and compliance teams. A startup has a founder reading legal blogs at midnight.",
