  "context": "Western nations use financial sanctions as a primary foreign policy tool, leveraging dollar dominance to punish adversaries. Sanctions work in the short term — targeted economies suffer. But each sanctions episode teaches the rest of the world a lesson: dollar dependency is a strategic vulnerability. Countries accelerate development of alternative payment systems, bilateral currency agreements, and reserve diversification. China's CIPS, Russia's SPFS, and BRICS settlement mechanisms all gained momentum after major sanctions events. The weapon works, but each use dulls it and accelerates the very dedollarization it was designed to prevent.",
