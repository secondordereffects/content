  "context": "Startups stay private longer to avoid public market scrutiny, quarterly earnings pressure, and regulatory burden. The median time to IPO stretched from 4 years (2000) to 12+ years (2024). Founders and VCs celebrate this as strategic patience. But extended private timelines create a liquidity crisis for employees, early investors, and the companies themselves. Employee stock options expire or get taxed before they can be exercised. Early investors are locked in for a decade-plus. And companies build cultures around paper valuations that may never be realized, creating misaligned incentives throughout the organization.",
