  "context": "The creator economy narrative is seductive: anyone can build an audience, monetize their passion, and escape the 9-to-5. Platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Substack, and Patreon have enabled over 200 million people globally to identify as content creators. But the economics follow a brutal power law distribution that mirrors — and in many cases exceeds — the inequality of traditional employment. The top 1% of creators capture over 90% of total revenue. The median creator earns less than $500/year. Most never earn enough to cover the tools and time they invest. The platforms benefit regardless: every creator, profitable or not, generates content that drives engagement and ad revenue. The creator economy didn't democratize wealth creation — it created a new class of unpaid content laborers who subsidize platform valuations with their free work.",
