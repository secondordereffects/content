  "context": "SaaS companies live and die by metrics: ARR, NDR, CAC payback, Rule of 40. Investors use these as shorthand for health, and founders optimize accordingly. But when metrics become the goal rather than a proxy for value, companies learn to game them. Multi-year contracts inflate ARR without proving retention. Professional services revenue gets bundled into subscriptions. Churn is masked by expansion revenue from price increases. The metrics look healthy while the underlying business deteriorates, and the gap only becomes visible during downturns when renewals actually test customer commitment.",
