  "context": "Top-tier VC backing is treated as validation — if Sequoia or a16z invested, the company must be good. This signal cascades through the ecosystem. Follow-on investors pile in based on the lead investor's reputation rather than independent diligence. Talent joins because the VC brand signals success. Customers sign because the funding signals stability. But the signal is circular: the company looks good because top VCs invested, and top VCs look good because their companies look good. When the signal breaks — as it did with FTX (Sequoia), WeWork (SoftBank), and Theranos (multiple top VCs) — the cascade reverses. The same herd behavior that inflated the company accelerates its collapse. The venture signaling system optimizes for pattern matching, not truth.",
