  "context": "Digital aggregators (Google, Amazon, Uber, Airbnb) win by owning demand and commoditizing supply. The theory says aggregators create value by reducing transaction costs and improving matching. Initially this is true — consumers get better prices and selection, suppliers get access to customers. But as aggregators achieve dominance, the dynamic inverts. Suppliers become dependent and lose pricing power. Consumers face reduced choice as the aggregator optimizes for its own margins. The platform that started by serving both sides begins extracting from both sides, and switching costs make escape nearly impossible.",
