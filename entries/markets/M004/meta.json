  "context": "Modern markets appear deeply liquid — tight spreads, deep order books, instant execution. Investors build portfolios assuming they can exit positions quickly at current prices. But market liquidity is a fair-weather friend. It's abundant when you don't need it and vanishes when you do. During the March 2020 COVID crash, even US Treasury markets — the most liquid in the world — seized up. Corporate bond ETFs traded at 5% discounts to NAV. Crypto markets regularly experience 20-30% drops in minutes as liquidity evaporates. The illusion is created by algorithmic market makers who provide liquidity in calm conditions but withdraw simultaneously during stress. The order book that showed 10,000 shares at the bid disappears in milliseconds when volatility spikes. Investors who sized positions based on normal liquidity find they can't exit without massive slippage.",
