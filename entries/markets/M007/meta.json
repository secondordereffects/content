  "context": "SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) were marketed as democratizing IPO access — retail investors could invest alongside sponsors in pre-IPO companies. Between 2020-2021, over 600 SPACs raised $160B+. The pitch was compelling: skip the traditional IPO process, go public faster, with forward-looking projections that traditional IPOs can't include. But the incentive structure is fundamentally misaligned. SPAC sponsors get 20% of the company (the 'promote') regardless of post-merger performance. Sponsors are incentivized to complete any deal before the deadline, not to find good deals. The forward projections that attracted retail investors were wildly optimistic — 75% of SPACs that completed mergers traded below their $10 trust value within a year. Retail investors provided the capital; sponsors captured the returns.",
