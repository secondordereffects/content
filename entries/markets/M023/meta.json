  "context": "Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services (Klarna, Afterpay, Affirm) reframe debt as a payment method. Split any purchase into 4 interest-free installments. The friction of borrowing disappears — no credit check, no interest (initially), integrated at checkout. Consumers spend more per transaction, merchants see higher conversion rates, and BNPL companies grow explosively. But underneath the frictionless UX, consumers are accumulating fragmented debt across multiple providers, invisible to traditional credit reporting, and increasingly unable to track their total obligations.",
