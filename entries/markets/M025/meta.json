  "context": "A country imposes tariffs on imports to protect domestic industries and reduce trade deficits. The first-order effect is straightforward: imported goods become more expensive, domestic producers gain a price advantage. But trading partners retaliate with their own tariffs. Supply chains reorganize. Consumers pay more. The industries the tariffs were meant to protect often end up worse off as their export markets shrink and input costs rise.",
