  "context": "Reaching a $1B+ valuation — unicorn status — became the defining goal of the startup ecosystem. VCs push for it because it validates their fund thesis. Founders chase it because it attracts talent, press, and follow-on funding. But the unicorn valuation creates its own gravity. Once a company is valued at $1B+, it can't raise a down round without devastating consequences — employee morale collapses, option pools become worthless, and the signal to the market is toxic. So the company must grow into its valuation or die trying. This forces unsustainable growth spending, delays profitability indefinitely, and creates zombie unicorns — companies valued at billions that can't IPO, can't be acquired (too expensive), and can't raise (valuation too high). The valuation that was supposed to signal success becomes a trap.",
