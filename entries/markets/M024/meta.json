  "context": "In January 2021, retail traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets drove GameStop's stock from $20 to $483 in two weeks. AMC, BlackBerry, and other heavily shorted stocks followed. The narrative was David vs. Goliath: retail investors beating hedge funds at their own game. But the second-order effects reshaped market structure in ways that hurt the very retail investors who celebrated. Payment for order flow (PFOF) — the mechanism that makes 'free' trading possible — means retail orders are sold to market makers who profit from the spread. The meme stock phenomenon revealed that retail traders aren't the customers of free brokerages; they're the product. Meanwhile, the volatility triggered regulatory scrutiny, increased margin requirements, and demonstrated that coordinated retail buying creates the same systemic risks as coordinated institutional selling.",
