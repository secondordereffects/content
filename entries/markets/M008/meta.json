  "context": "Every product is becoming a subscription. Software, media, fitness, food, razors, cars — the subscription model promises predictable recurring revenue for businesses and convenience for consumers. But consumers have a finite budget and finite tolerance for recurring charges. The average American household now manages 12+ subscriptions totaling $200-300/month. Subscription fatigue is setting in. Churn rates are rising. And the 'predictable revenue' that investors love is becoming less predictable as consumers ruthlessly audit their monthly charges.",
