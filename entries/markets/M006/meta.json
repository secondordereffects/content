  "context": "Cryptocurrency projects market decentralization as a feature that transcends national regulation. When one jurisdiction tightens rules, projects move to friendlier ones — from the US to Singapore, from China to Dubai, from the EU to the Cayman Islands. This regulatory arbitrage was supposed to prove that decentralized finance couldn't be regulated. Instead, it created a race to the bottom where the least regulated jurisdictions attract the most capital and the most fraud. FTX operated from the Bahamas specifically to avoid US oversight. Terraform Labs was based in Singapore. The consumers who lose money in these lightly-regulated jurisdictions have no recourse. Meanwhile, legitimate crypto projects in regulated jurisdictions face compliance costs that offshore competitors don't, creating an uneven playing field that rewards regulatory evasion.",
