  "context": "As banks retreat from lending due to post-2008 regulation, private credit funds fill the gap, growing from $500B to $1.7T in assets by 2024. Institutional investors chase higher yields in a low-rate hangover environment. But private credit lacks the transparency, mark-to-market discipline, and regulatory oversight of public markets. Loans are valued by the lenders themselves, defaults are restructured quietly, and correlations between funds are unknown. The opacity that makes private credit attractive to borrowers also makes systemic risk invisible until it materializes.",

  "hypothesis": "Private credit offers better risk-adjusted returns than public fixed income.",
