  "context": "Central banks hold interest rates near zero (ZIRP) for over a decade to stimulate economic growth. Cheap capital floods the market. Companies that would have failed under normal conditions survive on cheap debt and venture funding. These 'zombie companies' — firms that can't cover interest payments from operating income — consume capital, talent, and market share without creating sustainable value. When rates rise, the zombies die all at once, creating cascading failures across the economy.",
