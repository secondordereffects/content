  "context": "Network effects are celebrated as the ultimate moat — each new user makes the product more valuable for all users. But network effects work in both directions. The same dynamics that drive explosive growth can drive explosive decline. When users start leaving, the product becomes less valuable for remaining users, accelerating departure. MySpace, Vine, Clubhouse, and countless others discovered that network effects are a flywheel that spins both ways.",
