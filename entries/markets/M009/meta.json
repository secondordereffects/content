  "context": "SaaS companies adopt freemium models to reduce acquisition friction. Give the product away, let users experience value, then convert them to paid. The model works brilliantly for a few (Slack, Dropbox, Zoom) and fails quietly for most. The median freemium conversion rate is 2-5%. The free tier attracts users who never intended to pay, consumes support and infrastructure resources, and creates a ceiling that most companies cannot break through.",
