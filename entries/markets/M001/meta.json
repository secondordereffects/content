  "context": "Index funds are the greatest financial innovation of the past 50 years. Jack Bogle's insight was simple: most active managers underperform the index after fees, so just buy the index. The data is overwhelming — over 20-year periods, 90%+ of active funds underperform their benchmark. Trillions of dollars have flowed from active to passive management. But index funds work because active managers do the work of price discovery. When passive ownership crosses a threshold — currently estimated at 40-50% of total market cap — the mechanism that makes index investing rational begins to break down. Stocks get bought and sold based on index membership, not fundamentals. Capital allocation becomes mechanical. Price signals that guide the economy become distorted. The strategy that works because others do the hard work of analysis stops working when nobody does the analysis anymore.",
