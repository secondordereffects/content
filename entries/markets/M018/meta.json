  "context": "Startups take venture debt to extend runway without dilution, treating it as cheap capital between equity rounds. Lenders market it as founder-friendly financing. But venture debt comes with covenants, warrants, and acceleration clauses that activate precisely when companies are most vulnerable. If the next equity round doesn't materialize or comes at a lower valuation, debt covenants trigger, forcing repayment when cash is scarce. The non-dilutive financing that was supposed to preserve founder equity often ends up destroying more value than a down round would have.",
