  "context": "Algorithmic trading now accounts for 60-70% of US equity volume. The promise was efficiency — algorithms process information faster, reduce spreads, and provide liquidity. And in normal conditions, they do. But most trading algorithms are trained on similar data, use similar signals, and optimize for similar objectives. When market conditions shift, they react simultaneously in the same direction. This creates herding behavior at machine speed. Flash crashes, liquidity vacuums, and cascading sell-offs happen in milliseconds, faster than any human circuit breaker can respond. The 2010 Flash Crash, the 2015 ETF dislocation, and the 2020 COVID crash all showed algorithmic herding amplifying volatility rather than dampening it. The market is more efficient on average but more fragile at the extremes.",
