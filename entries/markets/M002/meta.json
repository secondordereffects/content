  "context": "Robinhood pioneered commission-free stock trading in 2015, and by 2020 every major brokerage had followed. The pitch was democratization — remove the $7-10 per trade barrier and let everyone participate in markets. Trading volumes exploded. Millions of new retail investors opened accounts. But free trading isn't free. The revenue shifted from commissions to payment for order flow (PFOF), where brokerages sell customer orders to market makers like Citadel Securities. This creates a structural conflict of interest: the brokerage's customer is the market maker, not the retail investor. Worse, zero friction encourages overtrading. Retail investors who would have thought twice about a $7 trade now execute dozens of speculative trades daily. The gamification of trading — confetti animations, push notifications, fractional shares — turned investing into entertainment, and entertainment into losses.",
