  "context": "Gig economy platforms — Uber, DoorDash, Fiverr, Upwork, TaskRabbit — promise flexibility and freedom. Be your own boss. Work when you want. Set your own rates. The reality for most gig workers is a race to the bottom driven by platform dynamics. Platforms profit from oversupply: more workers means lower prices, faster fulfillment, and better customer experience. So they continuously recruit new workers, driving down per-gig earnings. Workers compete on price because the platform controls discovery and ranking. The 'flexibility' of gig work means no benefits, no job security, no career progression, and earnings that often fall below minimum wage after accounting for expenses. The platforms externalize the costs of employment (healthcare, retirement, equipment, insurance) onto workers while capturing the value of their labor through take rates of 20-40%.",
