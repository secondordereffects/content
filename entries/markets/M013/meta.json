  "context": "Institutional investors pour trillions into ESG-labeled funds, believing capital allocation can drive corporate responsibility. Fund managers respond by creating ESG products that maximize inflows while minimizing portfolio disruption. The result is an equilibrium where ESG ratings become a compliance exercise rather than a change mechanism. Companies hire sustainability officers, publish glossy reports, and optimize for rating agency criteria without fundamentally altering operations. Meanwhile, the ESG label commands premium fees, creating a financial incentive to maintain the appearance of responsibility over its substance.",
