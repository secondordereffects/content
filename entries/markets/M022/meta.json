  "context": "The AI hype cycle has driven unprecedented capital allocation into AI companies and infrastructure. In 2024 alone, AI startups raised over $100B globally. Nvidia's market cap exceeded $3T. Every company added 'AI' to their pitch deck. But the revenue generated by AI products is a fraction of the capital invested. The gap between AI infrastructure spending and AI revenue is estimated at $500B+. History suggests this gap closes in one of two ways: revenue catches up (rare) or valuations crash (common).",
