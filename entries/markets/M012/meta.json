  "context": "Stock buybacks have become the dominant form of capital return in corporate America. S&P 500 companies spent over $900 billion on buybacks in 2023 alone — more than they spent on capital expenditure, R&D, or employee compensation increases combined. The mechanics are simple: company buys its own shares, reducing share count, which increases earnings per share even if actual earnings are flat. Executives love buybacks because their compensation is tied to EPS and stock price. Shareholders love the tax-efficient return. But buybacks systematically hollow out companies by diverting capital from investment in future growth, workforce development, and resilience. Companies that buy back aggressively during good times have no cash reserves during downturns and must lay off workers or take on debt to survive.",
