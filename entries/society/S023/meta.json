  "context": "Parents install location-tracking apps on children's phones for safety — knowing where your child is provides peace of mind. The technology is frictionless: real-time GPS, geofencing alerts, movement history. But constant surveillance fundamentally alters the parent-child relationship. Children who know they're tracked develop evasion strategies rather than judgment. They leave phones with friends, use secondary devices, or simply stop going places that might trigger parental concern. The tracking app replaces the trust-building conversations that actually keep children safe, and when children eventually gain independence (college, first job), they lack the internal navigation skills that unsurveilled adolescence develops.",
