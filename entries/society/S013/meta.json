  "context": "Wearables and health apps promise empowerment through data — track your steps, sleep, heart rate, calories, and you'll make better health decisions. The quantified self movement turned personal metrics into a lifestyle. But constant measurement creates constant evaluation. Users check their sleep score and feel anxious about not sleeping well enough — which makes sleep worse. They obsess over step counts instead of enjoying walks. They panic over heart rate variability readings they don't understand. The data that was supposed to reduce health anxiety amplifies it. Orthosomnia — anxiety about sleep data — is now a recognized clinical phenomenon. The quantified self creates a feedback loop where measurement produces anxiety, anxiety worsens the metric, and the worsened metric produces more anxiety.",
