  "context": "People are told to curate their information diet — follow experts, mute noise, subscribe to quality sources. The advice sounds reasonable. But curation algorithms and human confirmation bias work together to create echo chambers where people only encounter information that confirms their existing beliefs. Social media platforms optimize for engagement, and agreement is more engaging than challenge. Over time, users develop epistemic closure — a state where no external evidence can change their beliefs because the information ecosystem has been purged of contradicting viewpoints. The person inside the echo chamber doesn't feel uninformed; they feel extremely well-informed. They've read hundreds of articles, all confirming the same narrative. The volume of confirming information creates false confidence.",
