  "context": "Gamification — adding points, badges, streaks, and leaderboards to non-game activities — is everywhere. Duolingo streaks, Fitbit step challenges, LinkedIn profile completion bars, Starbucks reward stars. The premise is that extrinsic rewards increase engagement. And they do, initially. But research on motivation crowding shows that extrinsic rewards can destroy intrinsic motivation. People who exercised for health start exercising for streaks — and when the streak breaks, they stop entirely. Students who read for curiosity start reading for points — and read only what earns points. The gamification creates a dependency on external validation that replaces the internal drive it was supposed to enhance. When the game mechanics are removed or the novelty fades, engagement drops below pre-gamification levels.",
