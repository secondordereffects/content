  "context": "Entertainment and consumer industries increasingly rely on nostalgia — reboots, remakes, sequels, retro aesthetics, and legacy IP. Studios greenlight known properties over original ideas because nostalgia reduces financial risk. Audiences reward this with their wallets. But the nostalgia economy creates a cultural stagnation loop: investment flows to the past, starving original creators of funding and attention. New cultural movements struggle to emerge when every platform slot is filled by a reboot. The generation that grew up on original content now consumes recycled versions, while the next generation inherits a culture that looks backward instead of forward.",
