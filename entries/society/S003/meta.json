  "context": "The attention economy treats human attention as a resource to be extracted. Every app, platform, and notification competes for a finite cognitive budget. The average person now encounters 6,000-10,000 ads per day, checks their phone 96 times, and context-switches between tasks every 3 minutes. The cumulative effect is a population-level decline in sustained attention, deep reading ability, and complex reasoning. We're not getting dumber — we're getting more distracted, which produces the same outcome.",
