  "context": "Public accountability through social media — often called 'cancel culture' — emerged as a mechanism for holding powerful people accountable when institutions failed to do so. The #MeToo movement demonstrated its power: serial abusers who had been protected by institutional structures were finally held accountable through public pressure. But the mechanism doesn't have a proportionality dial. The same dynamics that topple genuine abusers also destroy careers over decade-old tweets, ambiguous jokes, and good-faith disagreements. The chilling effect is the second-order consequence: when the cost of saying the wrong thing is career destruction, people stop saying anything that might be misinterpreted. Self-censorship becomes the rational strategy. Public discourse narrows. Intellectual risk-taking declines. The people most affected are not the powerful — they have PR teams — but ordinary people who can't afford the reputational risk.",
