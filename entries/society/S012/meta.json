  "context": "Remote work enabled a new class of digital nomads — workers earning developed-world salaries while living in developing-world locations. Bali, Lisbon, Mexico City, Medellín, and Chiang Mai became hotspots. The narrative is freedom and cultural exchange. The reality is economic displacement. Digital nomads earning $5,000-15,000/month move into neighborhoods where locals earn $500-1,500/month. Rents spike. Local businesses pivot to serve nomad tastes and budgets. Cafes that served $1 coffee now charge $5. Housing that was affordable to locals becomes Airbnb inventory. The gentrification pattern that took decades in Brooklyn happens in months in Canggu. Local communities bear the costs of infrastructure strain while nomads contribute minimally to local tax bases, often on tourist visas.",
