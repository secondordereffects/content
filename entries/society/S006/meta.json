  "context": "The meritocracy narrative — that success comes from hard work and talent — is foundational to modern capitalism. It motivates effort, justifies inequality, and provides a framework for social mobility. But research consistently shows that outcomes correlate more strongly with starting conditions (family wealth, zip code, network access) than with individual effort or ability. The meritocracy myth creates a double bind: those who succeed attribute it to merit (ignoring structural advantages), and those who fail blame themselves (ignoring structural barriers). This self-reinforcing narrative makes systemic reform harder because both winners and losers internalize the framework. The myth doesn't just describe reality inaccurately — it actively shapes behavior in ways that perpetuate the inequality it claims to solve.",
