  "context": "Recommendation algorithms on YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, and Facebook optimize for engagement — time spent, clicks, shares. Outrage, fear, and extreme content generate more engagement than moderate content. The algorithm doesn't have an ideology; it has a metric. And that metric systematically pushes users toward increasingly extreme content because extreme content keeps them watching. A person who watches a fitness video gets recommended diet content, then body image content, then eating disorder content. A person interested in politics gets pushed toward conspiracy theories. The pipeline is the product.",
