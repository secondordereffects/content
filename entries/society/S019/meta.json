  "context": "Awareness campaigns, social media activism, and corporate social responsibility statements promise to drive change by raising visibility. Change your profile picture, share a hashtag, sign a petition, buy the product with the cause-marketing label. These actions feel meaningful — they signal values and create social pressure. But research on moral licensing shows that symbolic actions substitute for substantive ones. People who signal virtue feel they've 'done their part' and reduce actual charitable giving, volunteering, and behavioral change. Companies that issue diversity statements reduce actual diversity spending. The awareness campaign that was supposed to be the first step becomes the only step. The signal replaces the substance.",
