  "context": "After decades of data breaches, surveillance revelations, and privacy policy theater, a growing segment of the population has given up on privacy. 'I have nothing to hide' becomes the default stance. People share everything on social media, accept all cookies without reading, and trade personal data for minor conveniences. This isn't informed consent — it's learned helplessness. And it creates a society where privacy becomes a luxury good available only to those with the knowledge and resources to protect it.",
