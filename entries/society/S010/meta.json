  "context": "Dating apps promised to solve the fundamental problem of meeting compatible partners. Instead of being limited to your social circle, workplace, or neighborhood, you could access thousands of potential matches. The logic seemed unassailable: more options lead to better outcomes. But behavioral economics predicts exactly what happened. Barry Schwartz's paradox of choice — the phenomenon where more options lead to worse decisions and lower satisfaction — plays out with devastating clarity in dating apps. Users swipe through hundreds of profiles, develop evaluation fatigue, reduce each person to a 2-second snap judgment, and paradoxically become less likely to commit to any single match. The result: a generation that has more access to potential partners than any in history, yet reports record levels of loneliness, dating dissatisfaction, and declining relationship formation rates.",
