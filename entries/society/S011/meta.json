  "context": "Influencer marketing grew from a niche tactic to a $21B industry by promising authentic recommendations from trusted voices. The premise: people trust people more than brands. And initially, it worked. But as the money flowed in, authenticity eroded. Influencers promote products they don't use, disclose sponsorships in tiny text, and manufacture fake enthusiasm for anything that pays. Audiences have become cynical — 67% of consumers say they trust influencer recommendations less than they did 3 years ago. The FTC requires disclosure, but enforcement is minimal. The result is a trust deficit that extends beyond influencers to all online recommendations. When every review might be paid, every recommendation might be sponsored, and every 'honest opinion' might be an ad, consumers trust nothing — including genuinely helpful recommendations.",
