  "context": "Technology makes life more convenient — food delivery, ride-hailing, smart home automation, one-click purchasing. Each convenience individually seems harmless and beneficial. But convenience is additive and compounding. Each layer of convenience removes a small friction that previously served a purpose: walking to the store provided exercise, cooking built a life skill, navigating without GPS developed spatial reasoning. As convenience layers accumulate, basic life competencies atrophy. People who can't cook, can't navigate, can't fix basic things, can't entertain themselves without a screen. The dependency isn't on any single service — it's on the entire convenience infrastructure. When it fails (delivery app outage, power outage, internet down), the impact is disproportionate because the underlying skills have atrophied.",
