  "context": "Tipping in the US has expanded from sit-down restaurants to coffee shops, takeout counters, food trucks, self-checkout kiosks, and even retail stores. Digital payment systems present tip prompts starting at 18-25% for interactions that never previously involved tipping. The social pressure of a screen turned toward you while the worker watches creates compliance. Tips that were once rewards for exceptional service have become subsidies for wages that employers should be paying. The system transfers labor costs from businesses to customers through guilt.",
