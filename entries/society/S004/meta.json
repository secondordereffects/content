  "context": "The average American child receives their first smartphone at age 11. By 13, most have active social media accounts. Parents give phones for safety — location tracking, emergency contact, coordination. Schools allow them for educational apps. The logic seems sound: digital literacy is essential, and phones keep kids connected and safe. But the data from the first generation raised on smartphones (born after 2010) is alarming. Rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide among adolescents have increased 50-150% since 2012, correlating precisely with smartphone adoption curves. Jonathan Haidt's research documents how phone-based childhood fundamentally rewired social development: replacing play-based learning with screen-based consumption, replacing in-person friendship with parasocial relationships, and replacing boredom (which drives creativity) with infinite stimulation.",
