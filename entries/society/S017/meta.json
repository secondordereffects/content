  "context": "Hustle culture glorifies overwork as a virtue. 'Rise and grind.' 'Sleep when you're dead.' 'If you're not working on your side project at midnight, you don't want it badly enough.' Social media amplifies the message through entrepreneur influencers who perform productivity as content. The narrative is seductive: success is a direct function of hours worked, and anyone who isn't succeeding simply isn't working hard enough. But the data tells a different story. Productivity peaks at 50 hours per week and declines sharply after 55. Chronic overwork increases cardiovascular disease risk by 35%, depression by 40%, and all-cause mortality by 20%. The WHO classified burnout as an occupational phenomenon in 2019. Hustle culture doesn't produce more output — it produces more hours of declining-quality work from increasingly unhealthy people who blame themselves for the inevitable burnout.",
