  "context": "The subscription economy promises access over ownership — subscribe to what you love, cancel anytime. Consumers accumulate subscriptions for streaming, music, news, fitness, software, and meal kits. The average American household now pays for 12+ subscriptions totaling $200-300/month. But subscription fatigue creates a paradox: people subscribe to signal identity (the kind of person who reads The Atlantic, uses Peloton, watches arthouse films) but engage with a fraction of what they pay for. The subscriptions become identity markers rather than utility, and canceling feels like abandoning part of who you are.",
