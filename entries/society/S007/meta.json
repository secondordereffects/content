  "context": "Online education was supposed to democratize access — anyone with an internet connection could learn from the best teachers. MOOCs, virtual classrooms, and educational apps promised to level the playing field. COVID-19 forced the experiment at scale. The results were devastating for equity. Students with stable internet, quiet study spaces, engaged parents, and personal devices thrived. Students without those resources fell further behind. Learning loss was 2-3x greater for low-income students. The digital divide became an education divide. Even post-pandemic, the shift toward hybrid and online learning persists, and the students who were already disadvantaged continue to fall behind. The technology that promised to democratize education amplified the very inequalities it was supposed to solve.",
