  "context": "People compulsively consume negative news on their phones — doomscrolling. The behavior feels like staying informed. In reality, it's a stress response that creates learned helplessness. Constant exposure to problems you can't solve — climate change, political dysfunction, global conflict — trains the brain that action is futile. The most informed people become the most paralyzed. They know everything that's wrong and feel powerless to change any of it.",
