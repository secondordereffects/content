  "context": "The 24/7 news cycle was supposed to keep people better informed. Instead, it created a collective attention deficit where every crisis is urgent for 48-72 hours and then forgotten entirely. The news media's business model depends on novelty — yesterday's disaster doesn't generate clicks. So the cycle moves on, and with it, public attention, political pressure, and accountability. The Maui wildfires, the East Palestine train derailment, the Flint water crisis — each dominated headlines for days, then vanished from public consciousness while the affected communities continued to suffer for years. The news cycle doesn't just fail to sustain attention; it actively trains the public to treat every crisis as temporary and every outrage as disposable.",
