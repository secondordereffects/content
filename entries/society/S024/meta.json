  "context": "People overwhelmed by screen time and social media take digital detoxes — weekend phone fasts, social media breaks, tech-free vacations. The wellness industry promotes these as resets. Initial results feel transformative: better sleep, more presence, reduced anxiety. But detoxes treat symptoms without addressing the structural dependencies that created the problem. When the detox ends, people return to the same digital environment with the same design patterns optimized for engagement. Usage often rebounds to higher levels than before, as accumulated notifications, messages, and FOMO create a binge-purge cycle that mirrors disordered eating patterns.",
